# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# About this project
In this project, when the app first loads, it's going to reach out to the API and get 100 of the most popular meme-images at that time. And give the user the ability to enter the text that shows up on the top and bottom of image. And also to click a button to randomly choose a new meme-image.

# What I learnt from this?
* **Event Listeners:** An event listener is a procedure in JavaScript that waits for an event to occur.
* **State:** The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component. 
* **Conditional Rendering:** It allows us to create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need.
* **Forms:**  Forms allows users to interact with the web page
* **Side Effects:** Data fetching, setting up a subscription, and manually changing the DOM in React components


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
